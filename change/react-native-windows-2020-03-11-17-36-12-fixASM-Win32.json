  "comment": "Two changes: 1. Use CW_DEFAULT for the window height & width in Playground-Win32 so    that Windows remembers the window size for us, instead of hardcoding    in a dumb random value. 2. Fix a braindead bug in AsyncStorageModuleWin32. The schema didn't    specify that the `key` column was a primary key, so instead of    multiSet() updating the `value` column in-place, it created new rows    every time... a very inefficient pure-functional data structure?    Strictly we should check userVersion to do the schema bump, but since    I think no one but me has used this, I'm OK saying \"remember to    delete the SQLite DB in %localappdata%.",
